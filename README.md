├── public/             # Built files go here

```

## Common Questions ❓

### Q: Where does it build my files?

A: By default, it looks for a 'client' folder and builds to 'public'. You can customize these paths.

### Q: Do I need a GitHub account?

A: Only if you want to use the GitHub features. You can still use build-only features without it.

### Q: Is the GitHub push feature secure?

A: Absolutely! We use your local Git configuration and GitHub CLI for secure authentication.

### Q: What if I'm new to Git?

A: Don't worry! Our smart setup wizard will guide you through the entire process.
